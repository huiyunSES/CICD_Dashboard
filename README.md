# CI/CD Dashboard

## Overview

The CI/CD dashboard integrates all CI/CD activities and provides functions for filtering data by time, product name, repository name, or GitHub users. The dashboard is designed to 4 personas: Executive Summary, Developer View, Project Lead View and Admin View.

The **Executive Summary** view presents an overview of the product team's performance through metrics, graphs, and charts.

The **Developer** View offers a comprehensive overview in the GitHub Actions that includes repository name, owner, coverage rate, workflow step and workflow run status, main branch and event type.

The **Project Lead** View provides a high-level snapshot of the project, including the product name, repository, main branch, workflow run status, event type and coverage rate.

The **Admin** View is where admin maps product and repositories
